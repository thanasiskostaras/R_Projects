In the Who Is Drunk and When in Ames, Iowa? project, you looked at breathalyzer test data from the State of Iowa. 
There was a lot of date-time manipulation that was hidden behind-the-scenes in that dataset. 
In this project, you will proceed to uncover temporal trends in the Ames breath alcohol data.
